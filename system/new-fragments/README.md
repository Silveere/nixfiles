# Fragments
These are Nix modules which aim to configure only one aspect of the system.
This can include installing and configuring single programs such as Steam,
MangoHud, Syncthing, or OpenSSH, as well as setting generic options for certain
hardware setups, such as NVIDIA PRIME Offloading.

## TODO
These are some fragments that I want to create:
- hardware/nvidia
- hardware/nvidia-supergfxd
- hardware/printing
	- CUPS
	- QZTray (maybe?)
- software/steam
- software/syncthing
- software/libreoffice
- software/ssh
- software/gnupg
- software/pam-gnupg (dep. software/gnupg)
